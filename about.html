When you need to pinpoint a physical address on your GPS, modern devices tend to be very good at determining the location you want based on proximity to your current position or the city and state you enter. However, if you need to mail a package, holiday card or bill payment, you won’t get far without the ZIP code for the address.

=======
ZIP codes guide every package and piece of mail through the
 postal system, ensuring everything arrives at the correct destination 
 as quickly as possible. Although you may memorize the phone numbers of 
 the people you call frequently, you probably don’t remember ZIP codes beyond your own, even for areas you visit frequently. Fortunately, it’s easy to find ZIP codes for cities and 
towns as well as specific addresses.
